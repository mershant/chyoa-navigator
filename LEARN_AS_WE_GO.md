## Learning Resources

### Essential Concepts
1. **HTML**: Structure and content
2. **CSS**: Styling and layout
3. **JavaScript**: Logic and interactivity
4. **APIs**: Connecting to other systems
5. **File Systems**: Reading and writing files

### Recommended Tools
- **Code Editor**: Visual Studio Code (free)
- **Browser**: Chrome/Firefox with developer tools
- **Testing**: SillyTavern development environment

### When You Get Stuck
1. **Read error messages carefully** - they usually tell you what's wrong
2. **Use console.log()** - print values to see what's happening
3. **Break problems into smaller pieces** - solve one thing at a time
4. **Google specific error messages** - someone else has had this problem
5. **Ask for help** - programming communities are very helpful
